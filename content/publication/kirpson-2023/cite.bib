 abstract = {This paper studies how macroeconomic news affected the spreads of
Italian sovereign bonds before and during the quantitative easing
by the European Central Bank. Daily changes in the bond spreads are
regressed on macroeconomic news shocks, where the news shocks are
computed as the difference between the published data and the
preceding private-sector forecasts. The analysis shows that
macroeconomic news shocks had economically and statistically
significant effects on Italian bond spreads in 2012--2014 before
quantitative easing, while the effects were negligible afterwards
although with a partial exception of a period in 2019 when the net
asset purchases were paused.},
