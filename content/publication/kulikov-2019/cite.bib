 abstract = {This paper takes a fresh look at the use of the Phillips curve and
various inflation expectation proxies for tracking euro area
inflation dynamics in the aftermath of the global financial crisis
of 2008. Because inflation expectations can be measured in a
multitude of alternative ways and the Phillips curve model itself
is subject to many potential specification choices, we employ a
novel thick modelling perspective that is data and model-agnostic
and estimate a large number of different Phillips curve models
using different data series for different components of our models.
We find that Phillips curve models without any forward-looking
expectational terms are uniformly the worst predictors of euro area
inflation rates after 2013, when measured for the RMSE criterion
across all models and specifications. This result underlines the
importance of inflation expectations in tracking the recent
dynamics of euro area inflation and shows that inflation
persistence alone or in combination with different slack and cost
push terms cannot satisfactorily explain the euro area inflation
story during the period of missing inflation after 2012. We also
illustrate the usefulness of the thick modelling approach for
practical modelling and forecasting of the euro area inflation
series.},
