abstract: This paper takes a fresh look at the use of the Phillips curve and various
  inflation expectation proxies for tracking euro area inflation dynamics in the aftermath
  of the global financial crisis of 2008. Because inflation expectations can be measured
  in a multitude of alternative ways and the Phillips curve model itself is subject
  to many potential specification choices, we employ a novel thick modelling perspective
  that is data and model-agnostic and estimate a large number of different Phillips
  curve models using different data series for different components of our models.
  We find that Phillips curve models without any forward-looking expectational terms
  are uniformly the worst predictors of euro area inflation rates after 2013, when
  measured for the RMSE criterion across all models and specifications. This result
  underlines the importance of inflation expectations in tracking the recent dynamics
  of euro area inflation and shows that inflation persistence alone or in combination
  with different slack and cost push terms cannot satisfactorily explain the euro
  area inflation story during the period of missing inflation after 2012. We also
  illustrate the usefulness of the thick modelling approach for practical modelling
  and forecasting of the euro area inflation series.
