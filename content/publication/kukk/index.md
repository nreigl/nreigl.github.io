abstract: The paper evaluates the outcomes of the borrower-based macroprudential policy
  measures that were introduced in Estonia in 2015. The core of the analysis is the
  response of the credit market in 2016--2021 to the upper limit on the debt serviceto-income
  ratio for new housing loans. The paper employs a novel approach based on the distribution
  of loan-level data, which allows the analysis to be made using only data from the
  post-treatment period. The average number of loans affected, meaning those that
  were rejected or taken in a smaller amount, is estimated to be on average around
  eleven per cent of the total number of new loans. The total stock of housing loans
  is on average around 1.7 per cent smaller. The losses in the volume of new loans
  due to the limit are fairly stable over the years despite the volume of housing
  loans growing in recent years.
