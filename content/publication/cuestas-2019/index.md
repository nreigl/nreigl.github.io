abstract: This paper presents empirical estimates of bank credit procyclicality for
  a sample of 11 Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEECs) for the period 2000Q1--2016Q4.
  In the first step we estimate a traditional-type panel VAR model and analyse the
  evolution of credit procyclicality in the CEECs by comparing the impulse response
  functions for different business cycle periods. The results confirm the existence
  of credit procyclicality in CEECs and show that procyclicality is higher during
  boom periods. Furthermore we observe the heterogeneity of credit procyclicality
  in the different countries in our sample. To explain the cross-country heterogeneity
  in credit procyclicality we construct an interacted panel VAR model (IPVAR) and
  analyse whether bank level competition, proxied by the aggregate Lerner index, constitutes
  a driving force of credit procyclicality. Our findings indicate that bank competition
  affects credit procyclicality and explains the differences in credit dynamics across
  CEECs. Specifically we show that the reaction of credit to a GDP shock is on average
  higher in a less competitive banking market.
