abstract: This paper studies how macroeconomic news affected the spreads of Italian
  sovereign bonds before and during the quantitative easing by the European Central
  Bank. Daily changes in the bond spreads are regressed on macroeconomic news shocks,
  where the news shocks are computed as the difference between the published data
  and the preceding private-sector forecasts. The analysis shows that macroeconomic
  news shocks had economically and statistically significant effects in 2012--2014
  before quantitative easing, but the effects were negligible afterwards with a possible
  exception of a period in 2019 when the net asset purchases were paused.
