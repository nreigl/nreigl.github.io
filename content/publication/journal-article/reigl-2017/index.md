abstract: The paper presents forecasts of headline and core inflation in Estonia with
  factor models in a recursive pseudo out-of-sample framework. The factors are constructed
  with a principal component analysis and are then incorporated into vector autoregressive
  (VAR) forecasting models. The analyses show that certain factor-augmented VAR models
  improve upon a simple univariate autoregressive model but the forecasting gains
  are small and not systematic. Models with a small number of factors extracted from
  a large dataset are best suited for forecasting headline inflation. The results
  also show that models with a larger number of factors extracted from a small dataset
  outperform the benchmark model in the forecast of Estonian headline and, especially,
  core inflation.
