abstract: This paper investigates how supply noise and demand noise contribute to
  business cycle fluctuations in three major European economies. A structural vector
  autoregressive model is used to identify supply, demand, supply noise and demand
  shocks. The identification scheme is built on nowcast errors of output growth and
  the inflation rate that are derived from the Consensus Economics Survey. The results
  indicate that positive supply noise and positive demand noise shocks have an expansionary
  effect on output, but their magnitude differs across countries. The two shocks contribute
  equally to business fluctuations, and jointly, they account for around one quarter
  of the total variation in GDP in each of the three countries.
