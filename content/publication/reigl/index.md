abstract: This paper complements the standard Basel countercyclical capital buffer
  framework by suggesting four additional measures for credit gaps that can be used
  to measure the financial cycle and to decide on countercyclical capital buffers
  for banks. The new measures behave similarly to the gaps calculated with the standard
  Basel one-sided Hodrick-Prescott filter in long samples, but they have the properties
  desired for countries with relatively short historical samples. While the standard
  Basel credit gaps have been deep in negative territory for many European Union countries
  since the Great Recession the new gaps are close to zero and the buffers suggested
  are more in line with the countercyclical capital buffer ratios that were in place
  in 2018.
