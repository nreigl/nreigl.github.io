I am available to supervise master students interested in pursuing research in the fields of monetary economics, business cycle theory, financial stability and macro finance. I welcome proposals that align with these areas, particularly those utilizing advanced quantitative methods such as R, Matlab, or Julia. Students can expect guidance tailored to developing strong empirical and theoretical skills, with an emphasis on policy-relevant research questions.

### Potential Research Topics for Master Theses

 - Determinants of High and Low Inflation Regimes
 - The Impact of Inflation Expectations on Labor Supply
 - Distinguishing Temporary and Permanent Effects of Inflation Shocks
