  abstract = {This paper presents empirical estimates of bank credit procyclicality for a sample of 11 Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEECs) for the period 2000Q1--2016Q4. In the first step we estimate a traditional-type panel VAR model and analyse the evolution of credit procyclicality in the CEECs by comparing the impulse response functions for different business cycle periods. The results confirm the existence of credit procyclicality in CEECs and show that procyclicality is higher during boom periods. Furthermore we observe the heterogeneity of credit procyclicality in the different countries in our sample. To explain the cross-country heterogeneity in credit procyclicality we construct an interacted panel VAR model (IPVAR) and analyse whether bank level competition, proxied by the aggregate Lerner index, constitutes a driving force of credit procyclicality. Our findings indicate that bank competition affects credit procyclicality and explains the differences in credit dynamics across CEECs. Specifically we show that the reaction of credit to a GDP shock is on average higher in a less competitive banking market.},

  abstract = {This paper empirically assesses the potential nonlinear relationship between competition and bank risk for a sample of commercial banks in the Baltic countries over the period 2000--2014. Competition is measured by two alternative indexes, the Lerner index and the market share, while we consider the Z-score and loan loss reserves as proxies for bank risk. In line with the theoretical predictions, we find an inverse U-shaped relationship between competition and financial stability. This then means that above a certain threshold, the lack of competition is likely to exacerbate the individual risk-taking behaviour of banks, and could be detrimental to the stability of the banking sector in the Baltic countries. The threshold is around 0.60 for the Lerner index, and close to 50\% for market share in terms of assets. The policy implications are that the existence of such a threshold suggests that the future evolution of the structure of the banking industry in these countries is of critical importance. Specifically, this implies that policy-makers should place greater emphasis on mergers and acquisitions to avoid any significant increase of banking sector concentration.},

The core of the analysis is the response of the credit market in 2016--2021 to the upper limit on the debt serviceto-income ratio for new housing loans. The paper employs a novel approach based on the distribution of loan-level data, which allows the analysis to be made using only data from the post-treatment period. The average number of loans affected, meaning those that were rejected or taken in a smaller amount, is estimated to be on average around eleven per cent of the total number of new loans. The total stock of housing loans is on average around 1.7 per cent smaller. The losses in the volume of new loans due to the limit are fairly stable over the years despite the volume of housing loans growing in recent years.},

  abstract = {This paper takes a fresh look at the use of the Phillips curve and various inflation expectation proxies for tracking euro area inflation dynamics in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008. Because inflation expectations can be measured in a multitude of alternative ways and the Phillips curve model itself is subject to many potential specification choices, we employ a novel thick modelling perspective that is data and model-agnostic and estimate a large number of different Phillips curve models using different data series for different components of our models. We find that Phillips curve models without any forward-looking expectational terms are uniformly the worst predictors of euro area inflation rates after 2013, when measured for the RMSE criterion across all models and specifications. This result underlines the importance of inflation expectations in tracking the recent dynamics of euro area inflation and shows that inflation persistence alone or in combination with different slack and cost push terms cannot satisfactorily explain the euro area inflation story during the period of missing inflation after 2012. We also illustrate the usefulness of the thick modelling approach for practical modelling and forecasting of the euro area inflation series.},

The factors are constructed with a principal component analysis and are then incorporated into vector autoregressive (VAR) forecasting models. The analyses show that certain factor-augmented VAR models improve upon a simple univariate autoregressive model but the forecasting gains are small and not systematic. Models with a small number of factors extracted from a large dataset are best suited for forecasting headline inflation. The results also show that models with a larger number of factors extracted from a small dataset outperform the benchmark model in the forecast of Estonian headline and, especially, core inflation.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to complement to standard Basel countercyclical capital buffer framework by suggesting additional measures for credit gaps that can be used to measure the financial cycle and to decide on countercyclical capital buffers for banks. Design/methodology/approach The paper concentrates on European Union countries with the data starting from 1970. The authors check whether the newly suggested buffers are in place and sizable before financial distress periods. Findings The new measures are: the change in the credit-to-GDP ratio over two years; the growth in credit compared to the eight-year moving average of growth in nominal GDP over two years; the growth in credit compared to annual nominal growth of 5\% over two years; and growth in credit relative to the nominal GDP trend value over two years. They behave similarly to the gaps calculated with the standard Basel one-sided Hodrick--Prescott filter in long samples. Originality/value The main contribution of the paper is to suggest new alternative measures of credit cycles that can be used in short samples and in case of structural breaks. New measures correlate well with actual countercyclical capital buffers in place in 2018.},

A structural vector autoregressive model is used to identify supply, demand, supply noise and demand shocks. The identification scheme is built on nowcast errors of output growth and the inflation rate that are derived from the Consensus Economics Survey. The results indicate that positive supply noise and positive demand noise shocks have an expansionary effect on output, but their magnitude differs across countries. The two shocks contribute equally to business fluctuations, and jointly, they account for around one quarter of the total variation in GDP in each of the three countries.},
